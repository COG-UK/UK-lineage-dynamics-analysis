# Phylogenetic data

Phylogenetic input data used in the analyses. 

## Sequence metadata

- [metadata.csv](metadata.csv)

Sequence metadata and identifiers for the 50,887 genome sequences used. The sequences themselves can be downloaded from [COG-UK](https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/) and [GISAID](http://www.gisaid.org). For complete details see the _Genomic data_ section of the Supplementary Materials.

## Maximum-likelihood trees

- [A.tree](A.tree)
- [B.tree](B.tree)
- [B.1.pruned.tree](B.1.pruned.tree)
- [B.1.X.tree](B.1.X.tree)
- [B.1.1.tree](B.1.1.tree)

Maximum-likelihood phylogenies generated for the 5 subsets of the sequence data constructed in FastTree (with branches shorter than 5e-6 substitutions per site collapsed). For complete details see the _Phylogenetic analysis and molecular clock dating_ section of the Supplementary Materials.

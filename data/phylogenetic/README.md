# Phylogenetic data

Phylogenetic input data used in the analyses. 

## Sequence metadata

- [metadata.csv](metadata.csv)

Sequence metadata and identifiers for the 50,887 genome sequences used. See Materials and Methods for details.


## Maximum-likelihood trees

- [A.tree](A.tree)
- [B.tree](B.tree)
- [B.1.pruned.tree](B.1.pruned.tree)
- [B.1.X.tree](B.1.X.tree)
- [B.1.1.tree](B.1.1.tree)

Maximum-likelihood phylogenies generated for the 5 subsets of the sequence data constructed in FastTree (with branches shorter than 5e-6 substitutions per site collapsed).
